# Product Requirements Document: Cube Color Learning Game

## Product Overview
A web-based educational game designed to help users develop spatial reasoning and color pattern recognition skills for solving Rubik's Cubes. The game challenges players to deduce hidden face colors by analyzing only the visible faces of a cube configuration.

## Core Concept
Players view a limited subset of a Rubik's Cube's faces (front + one vertical face: up OR down) and must correctly guess the colors of the hidden faces (left, right, back, and the remaining vertical face).

## Target Audience
- Rubik's Cube beginners learning cube notation and spatial reasoning
- Intermediate solvers looking to improve pattern recognition
- Puzzle enthusiasts interested in spatial reasoning games
- Age range: 10+ years old

## Game Objectives
1. Help players understand the standard Rubik's Cube color scheme
2. Develop spatial visualization skills
3. Reinforce understanding that opposite faces have specific color relationships
4. Make learning cube mechanics engaging and interactive

## Functional Requirements

### Core Gameplay
1. Display a 3D Rubik's Cube showing only:
   - Front face (always visible)
   - ONE vertical face (either up OR down)

2. Player must guess the colors of:
   - Left face
   - Right face
   - Back face
   - The hidden vertical face (down if up is shown, or up if down is shown)

3. Cube must follow standard Rubik's Cube color scheme:
   - White opposite Yellow
   - Blue opposite Green
   - Red opposite Orange

4. Multiple difficulty modes:
   - Easy: Guess 1-2 hidden faces
   - Medium: Guess 3 hidden faces
   - Hard: Guess all 4 hidden faces

### User Interface
1. 3D cube visualization with smooth rotation capability
2. Limited rotation: only allow viewing the designated visible faces
3. Color selection interface for guessing hidden faces
4. Clear visual indicators for:
   - Which faces need to be guessed
   - Which faces are locked/visible
   - Correct/incorrect guesses

### Feedback System
1. Immediate feedback after each guess
2. Visual indication of correct vs incorrect guesses
3. Explanatory hints showing why certain colors must be where they are
4. Educational pop-ups explaining cube color relationships

### Progression System
1. Level progression with increasing difficulty
2. Score tracking based on:
   - Accuracy
   - Number of attempts
   - Time taken (optional)
3. Achievement system for milestones
4. Statistics dashboard showing improvement over time

### Educational Features
1. Tutorial mode explaining:
   - Standard cube color scheme
   - Opposite face relationships
   - Spatial reasoning strategies
2. Hint system with configurable difficulty
3. Practice mode with unlimited attempts
4. Reference guide showing standard cube layout

## Technical Requirements

### Platform
- Web-based application (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript)
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet (minimum 768px width)
- Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)

### Performance
- Smooth 3D rendering at 60 FPS
- Load time < 3 seconds on standard broadband connection
- Support for touch and mouse input

### Data Persistence

  - Player progress
  - High scores
  - Preferences/settings
- Optional cloud save for cross-device play

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- Intuitive controls requiring minimal instruction
- Clear visual hierarchy and readable text (minimum 14px font)
- Accessible color palette with sufficient contrast
- Keyboard navigation support

### Accessibility
- Screen reader compatible labels
- Colorblind-friendly mode option
- Adjustable text size
- Alternative text descriptions for visual elements

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling
- No data loss during gameplay
- Consistent behavior across supported browsers

## User Stories

1. As a beginner, I want a tutorial that explains the standard Rubik's Cube color scheme so I can understand the game mechanics.

2. As a player, I want to see a 3D cube with limited faces visible so I can practice spatial reasoning.

3. As a competitive player, I want to track my accuracy and speed so I can measure my improvement.

4. As a learner, I want hints when I'm stuck so I can understand the logic behind color placement.

5. As a visual learner, I want to see an explanation when I guess wrong so I can learn from my mistakes.

6. As a mobile user, I want touch controls to rotate and interact with the cube.

7. As a colorblind user, I want alternative visual indicators (patterns/symbols) so I can play effectively.

## Success Metrics

1. User Engagement
   - Average session length > 5 minutes
   - Return rate > 40% within 7 days

2. Learning Effectiveness
   - Accuracy improvement > 20% after 10 games
   - Tutorial completion rate > 70%

3. Technical Performance
   - Page load time < 3 seconds
   - Frame rate maintained at 60 FPS
   - Error rate < 1%

## Out of Scope (Version 1.0)

- Actual cube solving mechanics
- Multiplayer or competitive modes
- Mobile app (native iOS/Android)
- Virtual reality support
- Custom cube size variations (4x4, 5x5, etc.)
- Cube scrambling algorithms
- Timer-based speedcubing features

## Future Considerations

- Progressive difficulty with scrambled cubes (not just standard orientation)
- Multiplayer challenge mode
- Integration with cube solving tutorials
- AR mode for smartphone cameras
- Community-created challenges
- Leaderboards and social features

## Dependencies

- 3D graphics library (Three.js or similar)
- Web storage API for persistence
- Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or vanilla JS)

## Timeline Considerations

Phase 1: Core game mechanics and basic UI
Phase 2: Tutorial and educational features
Phase 3: Progression system and statistics
Phase 4: Polish, accessibility, and performance optimization

## Open Questions

1. Should the visible vertical face (up/down) be randomly chosen or player-selected?
2. What should be the balance between time pressure and educational value?
3. Should there be penalties for incorrect guesses, or unlimited attempts?
4. How many levels should version 1.0 include?
5. Should cube rotation be manual or automatic/animated?
